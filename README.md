This is a little game written in Python using the Pygame module.
Use the left and right arrow keys to move your cat and avoid "Ana," the terrible guinea pig who steals your lives.

This program is not perfect at all — I'm just a hobbyist.

Controls:

Left Arrow: Move your cat to the left side of the screen
Right Arrow: Move your cat to the right side of the screen
Goal: Survive as long as you can by dodging Ana!

Feel free to play and improve my code if you want to!
